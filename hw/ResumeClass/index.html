<h2>Cover Letter</h2>

<p>
  My name is Kyle Larsen, and I am currently a Junior at the University of Miami. I am pursuing a major in Business Administration and a minor in Sports Administration. At the moment, I am interning during the school year for the University of Miami football team. This has taught me many things about how a Division 1 football team operates from the inside offices.<br><br>
